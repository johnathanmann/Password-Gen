## Summary
This site can be used to randomely generate a password through different prompts and confirms. The user can choose the length of their password (between 8-128 characters), if they want to include lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. 

The password is generated through the shuffling of various arrays. The arrays are created based on the specifications provided by the user. They are then trimmed down to be the users chosen length.
